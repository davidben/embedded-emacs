Embedded Emacs is a NPAPI plugin and Chrome extension pair that
replaces textareas with embedded emacs.

It uses the XEmbed-based NPAPI mode on Linux and emacs --parent-id to
embed your system emacs binary into your browser.

Known issues / TODO:
- if web page modified CSS of textarea, emacs instance does not update
- textareas do not update until emacs instance exits
- buildsystem does not package crx
- emacs 23.1 has a layout bug which can affect embedded-emacs. You may need to use 23.2 or later.
