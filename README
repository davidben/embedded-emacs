Embedded Emacs is a NPAPI plugin and Chrome extension pair that
replaces textareas with embedded emacs.

It uses the XEmbed-based NPAPI mode on Linux and emacs --parent-id to
embed your system emacs binary into your browser.

Known issues / TODO:
- if web page modified CSS of textarea, emacs instance does not update
- textareas do not update until emacs instance exits
- buildsystem does not package crx
- emacs23 seems to have a resizing bug, you may need a development build of emacs24 or so
