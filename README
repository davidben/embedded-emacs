Embedded Emacs is a NPAPI plugin and Chrome extension pair that
replaces textareas with embedded emacs.

It uses the XEmbed-based NPAPI mode on Linux and emacs --parent-id to
embed your system emacs binary into your browser.

Note: DO NOT USE THIS PLUGIN IN YOUR PRIMARY BROWSER. It exposes the
NPAPI plugin publically to all webpages. Private plugins don't work in
iframes; I need to talk to the Chrome extensions people to see if this
is intentional.

Known issues / TODO:
- plugin is public
- keyboard focus doesn't work (need to talk to Chrome guys)
- if web page modified CSS of textarea, emacs instance does not update
- textareas do not update until emacs instance exits
- trigger not configurable
- buildsystem does not build both 32-bit and 64-bit plugins
- buildsystem does not package crx
- emacs23 seems to have a resizing bug, you may need a development build of emacs24 or so
